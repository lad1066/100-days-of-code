# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finshed my Tribute Page for Free Code Camp. Coded from 11:20-01:20 - some of that was just figuring out how to use %#&@ing GitHub

**Thoughts:** I really don't understand GutHub at all.  It's not intuitive and everything seems much harder than it has to be.  I'm super frustrated with just the GitHub part and it's only Day 1. With CSS - I still have to google incesently and I'm not sure I understand the box model just yet but I feel I'm making progress.
