# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: June 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Portfolio page for FCC.  Figured out how to do the basics of a horizontal navigation bar - go me!

**Thoughts:** I only did 30 minutes today because of Pub Quiz but I'll add that on sometime this week, likely Sunday.  I'm glad I decided to do a little since I learned something new.  The box model is still confusing so I need to find some articles and really understand it.

### Day 2: June 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Portfolio page for FCC.  Got all the base html in there and started on the css.  Got stumped by background-color so I'll research tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I'm really understanding how html works and getting in the intial work before adding css. CSS is still frustrating me.  I feel like I'm forgetting things as soon as I learn them.  Will research some more tomorrow and go at it again.

### Day 1: June 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finshed my Tribute Page for Free Code Camp. Coded from 11:20-01:20 - some of that was just figuring out how to use %#&@ing GitHub

**Thoughts:** I really don't understand GutHub at all.  It's not intuitive and everything seems much harder than it has to be.  I'm super frustrated with just the GitHub part and it's only Day 1. With CSS - I still have to google incesently and I'm not sure I understand the box model just yet but I feel I'm making progress.
