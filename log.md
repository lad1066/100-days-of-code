# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 10: June 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the landing page code along and started back on my portfolio page. I'm excited to put what I've learned in to practice.

**Thoughts:** I really think I can get the portfolio page done this weekend and move on to javascript.  I feel like I'm really starting to understand how html and css work.

### Day 7-9: June 11-13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I'm so bad at updating multiple things. I've also been blogging so I forget to come over here and update. Blog link here: https://theadiposealternative.wordpress.com/

**Thoughts:** On Day 7 I figured out my problem was the bootstrap cdn link in codepen and I had, in fact, done everything correctly.  I decided to spend the next couple of days coding along with the bootstrap lessons and learned a TON!

### Day 6: June 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Ugh. Just ugh. I really thought I had a handle on using Bootstrap to create a navbar but I couldn't get anything to work in Code Pen.  So frustrated!

**Thoughts:** There has got to be something wrong with my version of Code Pen or something. I even copied code directly from a code pen with a working navbar and it didn't work.  I couldn't figure it out tonight but I'll try again tomorrow.

### Day 5: June 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went back to the udemy course I had started and coded along with the Bootstrap lesson. I really needed this BEFORE I started my Portfolio Page. Three days of frustration could have been avoided!! But I think I'll be able to make real progress as I go through the lesson. Today I just coded along with the examples. Tomorrow I'm going to start putting it in to practice as well as continuing the lessons

**Thoughts:** I only vaguely remember the Bootstrap lessons from freeCodeCamp and boy do I wish I'd recalled them before now. I was frustrated and didn't want to work on my Portfolio Page so I restarted the online course I'm doing. The lesson was Bootstrap and IT EXPLAINED SO MUCH!! Now I'm kicking myself but I'm excited to move forward.

### Day 4: June 08, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Portfolio page for FCC.  Figured out how to seperate my sections using divs but there's one that's giving me trouble so I'm going to work on that tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I worked for 85 minutes but was distracted throughout so it really should only count as an hour. No baseball tonight so I made the mistake of putting on AGT and it was a bridge too far. I'll have to figure something else out for the nights when the Rangers aren't playing. Learning CSS is a slow process and I do find myself getting frustrated, but it's pretty cool when I work something out.

### Day 3: June 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Portfolio page for FCC.  Figured out how to do the basics of a horizontal navigation bar - go me!

**Thoughts:** I only did 30 minutes today because of Pub Quiz but I'll add that on sometime this week, likely Sunday.  I'm glad I decided to do a little since I learned something new.  The box model is still confusing so I need to find some articles and really understand it.

### Day 2: June 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Portfolio page for FCC.  Got all the base html in there and started on the css.  Got stumped by background-color so I'll research tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I'm really understanding how html works and getting in the intial work before adding css. CSS is still frustrating me.  I feel like I'm forgetting things as soon as I learn them.  Will research some more tomorrow and go at it again.

### Day 1: June 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finshed my Tribute Page for Free Code Camp. Coded from 11:20-01:20 - some of that was just figuring out how to use %#&@ing GitHub

**Thoughts:** I really don't understand GutHub at all.  It's not intuitive and everything seems much harder than it has to be.  I'm super frustrated with just the GitHub part and it's only Day 1. With CSS - I still have to google incesently and I'm not sure I understand the box model just yet but I feel I'm making progress.
